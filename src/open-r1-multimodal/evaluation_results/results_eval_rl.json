However, the line graphs could benefit from more clarity in terms of legend and axis labels, especially since they are not immediately self-explanatory. The color coding for layers is consistent but does not add much value to the graph.\n\nOverall, the slide effectively communicates the research topic and provides a visual comparison, but it lacks some polish that would elevate its quality.\n</think>\n<answer>8.73</answer>",
