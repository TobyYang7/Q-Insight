## üî• Introduction
PLCC comparisons between our proposed Q-Insight and existing IQA metrics (left) and three example applications of our Q-Insight (right) are presented. Q-Insight demonstrates significantly improved performance compared to existing methods, especially on out-of-domain datasets. Additionally, Q-Insight effectively supports quality score regression, image degradation perception, and zero-shot image comparison reasoning tasks.

## üö© Updates
- 05.30 Released training and testing code, along with the pretrained model.
- 05.26 Released our v2 paper.
- 03.28 Released the Q-Insight technical report.

## üîß Dependencies and Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bytedance/Q-Insight.git
bash setup.sh
```

## ‚ö° Quick Inference
### Supported Tasks
#### Score Regression
```
cd src/eval/
python demo_score.py
```
#### Degradation Perception
```
cd src/eval/
python demo_dist.py
```
#### Image Comparison Reasoning
```
cd src/eval/
python demo_comparison.py
```

## üìñ Dataset Preparation for Training
#### Score Regression
Download meta files from [Data-DeQA-Score](https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhiyuanyou/Data-DeQA-Score/tree/main) and the source images from the [KONIQ](https://database.mmsp-kn.de/koniq-10k-database.html) dataset.
Arrange the folders in `./src/open-r1-multimodal/data`as follows:
```
|-- Data-DeQA-Score
  |-- KONIQ
    |-- images/*.jpg
    |-- metas
```
#### Degradation Perception
Download the `refA_sd_brief` subset from [KADIS-700K](https://modelscope.cn/datasets/zhiyuanyou/DataDepictQA/files).
Arrange the folders in `./src/open-r1-multimodal/data` as follows:
```
|-- KADIS-700K
  |-- refA_sd_brief
    |-- dist_imgs/*.jpg
    |-- metas/train_dist.json
```

#### Image Comparison Reasoning
Download the validation dataset of [DiffIQA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vZehlUPDyDfo6Mq1K8pAMe3pcjqdDRht).
Arrange the folders in `./src/open-r1-multimodal/data` as follows:
```
|-- DiffIQA
  |-- ValidationImage
    |-- images
    |-- train_comparison.json
```

## Training
#### Score Regression and Degradation Perception
```
cd src/open-r1-multimodal/
bash run_qinsight_score_and_dist.sh
```
#### Image Comparison Reasoning
```
cd src/open-r1-multimodal/
bash run_qinsight_comparison.sh
```
